# Overview

1. Spend no more than 5.0 hours on this assessment (Recomendation: Spend about an hour getting used to the codebase, and 4 actually working on the code). We are evaluating both the skill level of building a web app in addition to the quality within a tight timeline. Complete as much as you can within the allotted time. You may not complete it all, and that is ok.
2. Commit often to track progress. Keep commit messages informative.
3. Make an initial commit of an empty file with your name and start time commented on the top to start the time.
4. Run the app locally (use your local DB). This app supports SQL Server, and is running off of .NET 3.1
5. Submit your completed app through a public repository. This will allow us to pull down your code and run it locally ourselves.

## Requirements

You have just joined a team that is in the middle of a project. They only have this project partially completed and are in a high need for a developer who can just "jump right in". This codebase is their current progress, and you are tasked with the following:

1. There are a couple of TODO's across the code base. Find and complete those tasks. 
2. Write tests for this app, as many as you feel is needed. This can be a combination of tests (integration, unit, etc...). Test the services, and controllers. Remember, the incoming data, routes, and outgoing data cannot change. 
3. All incomming data to the controllers will be DTOs. All Outgoing data from the controllers, to the client, will be an HTTP response containing a DTO. 


Your final solution will be evaluated by the development team. After a thorough review, you may be asked for follow up to discuss your progress. Be prepared to discuss your work, and continue working on this code base with additional routes and tests.
